# Bruno-DaSilva's Dotfiles

At the moment, this does not actually contained dotfiles, but just my current .zshrc and iterm themes. Long term, this will become a proper dotfiles setup!

## Install instructions
* `brew tap homebrew/cask-fonts`
* `brew cask install font-meslo-nerd-font`
* `brew install zplug`
* `brew install zsh`
* `cp .zshrc ~/.zshrc`
* Import the gruvbox-dark iterm colors in to your iterm2 profile. Set it as the default profile.
* Close/open your terminal!
